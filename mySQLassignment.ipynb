    "# QUESTION.1 What is database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL database.\n",
    "# ANSWER A database is a structured collection of daya that is organised and stored in a way that allows for efficient \n",
    "# retrieval, updating, and management of that data. Database are essential for storing and managing large volumes of \n",
    "# information in various application, from websites to business system.\n",
    "#         SQL DATABASE:\n",
    "# 1.STRUCTURE DATA: SQL database are relational and work well with structured data, which means data is organized into tables \n",
    "# with predefined schemas.\n",
    "# 2.ACID Transactions: They support ACID(Atomicity,Consistency,Isolation,Durability) transations,ensuring data consistency \n",
    "# and  reliability.\n",
    "# 3. VERTICAL SCALING: SQL database typically scale vertically, meaning you can increase peroformance by adding more resource\n",
    "# (e.g.,CPU,RAM) to a single server.\n",
    "# EXAMPLE: MySQL,PostgreSQL,Oracle,MicrosoftSQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#        NoSQL Database:\n",
    "# 1. Flexible Data Modles: NoSQL database are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, allowing flexiblity in \n",
    "# data formats and schemas.\n",
    "# 2. BASE Transaction: They use BASE(Basically Available,soft state,Eventually consistency.) transactions, prioritizing \n",
    "# availability and scalability over strong consistency. \n",
    "# 3. Horizontal scaling : NoSQL database typically scale horizontally, distributing data across multiple servers to handle \n",
    "# high traffic loads.\n",
    "#     EXAMPLE: MongoDB, Cassandra,Redis, Amazon DynamoDB."

    "# QUESTION.2 What is DDL? Explain why CREATE,DROP ALERT, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "# ANSWER DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used for defining\n",
    "# and managing the structure of a database, including tables, indexes, and constraints. DDL statements are used to create,\n",
    "# modify, and delete database objects.  \n",
    "#                some common DDL statements and their explanations with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. CREATE: Purpose: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and \n",
    "# constraints.\n",
    "# Example : \n",
    " CREATE TABLE employees (\n",

    "     last_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "     hire_date DATE\n",
    " );\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. DROP: Purpose: The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects, such as tables, views, or indexes. \n",
    "# Example : \n",
    " DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. ALTER: Purpose: Although not mentioned in your question, ALTER is also a DDL statement used to modify the structure of\n",
    "# existing database objects, such as adding or dropping columns from a table.\n",
    "# Example :\n",
    " ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. TRUNCATE :Purpose: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table while keeping the table structure\n",
    "# intact. It's faster than the DELETE statement because it doesn't generate individual row delete statements and doesn't log\n",
    "# individual row deletions.\n",
    "#  Example :\n",
    " TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n"
